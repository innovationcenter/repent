#
# Rules that classify hosts by trust relationship. These are applied to
# every 'a' SATAN record. Basically, they translate the cryptic SATAN
# record data to something that is more suitable for reports.
#
# Format of this file is:
#
#	condition TABs relationship
# 
# The condition is a PERL expression, with full access to the global
# $target..$text variables.
#
# The relationship field specifies a name such as "remote login" or
# "file sharing".
#
# Empty lines and text after a "#" character are ignored. Long lines may
# be broken with backslash-newline.

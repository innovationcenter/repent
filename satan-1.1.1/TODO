TODO list for future (SATAN version 1.1, 2.0, whatever)
----------------------------------------------------------

o	Enable SATAN to fork and run several scans in parallel
o       Talk about sending mail/syslog to each host scanned
o       Look at and deal with subnet masks properly...
o       Put in a DNS walker
o       fix rex client strategy (rex client is currently not being used)
o       get a more complete list of banners from vendors and Internet
        on what is vulnerable and not, for the rules/* files.
o       many more bug tests, etc.
o	Add AFS testing support; currently there is none
o	Add SNMP testing/probing

And most importantly:

o       MAPS!  Big graphical maps that can *show* the relationships
        and are clickable to let users zoom into things, etc...

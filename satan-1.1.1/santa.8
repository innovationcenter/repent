.TH SANTA 8
.SH NAME
santa \- network security scanner
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B santa
.I [options] [primary_target(s)...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B SANTA
(Security Analysis Network Tool for Administrators) remotely probes
systems via the network and stores its findings in a database. The
results can be viewed with any Level 2 HTML browser that supports the
.I http
protocol (e.g.
.B Mosaic, Netscape,
etc.)
.PP
When no
.I primary_target(s)
are specified on the command line,
.B SANTA
starts up in interactive mode and takes commands from the HTML user
interface.
.PP
When
.I primary_target(s)
are specified on the command line,
.B SANTA
collects data from the named hosts, and, possibly, from hosts that it
discovers while probing a primary host. A primary target can be a host
name, a host address, or a network number. In the latter case,
.B SANTA
collects data from each host in the named network.
.PP
.B SANTA
can generate reports of hosts by type, service, vulnerability and by
trust relationship. In addition, it offers tutorials that explain the
nature of vulnerabilities and how they can be eliminated.
.PP
By default, the behavior of
.B SANTA
is controlled by a configuration file
.I (config/santa.cf).
The defaults can be overruled via command-line options or via buttons
etc.  in the HTML user interface.
.PP
Options:
.IP -a
Attack level (0=light, 1=normal, 2=heavy). At level 0,
.B
SANTA collects information about
.I RPC
services and from the
.I DNS.
At level 1,
.B SANTA
collects banners of well-known services such as
.I telnet, smtp
and
.I ftp,
and can usually establish the type of operating system.  At level 2,
.B SANTA
does a more extensive (but still non-intrusive) scan for services.
Level 2 scans may result in console error messages.
.IP "-A proximity_descent"
While
.B SANTA
extracts information from primary targets, it may discover other
hosts.  The
.I proximity_descent
controls by how much the
.I attack level
decreases when
.B SANTA
goes from primary targets to secondary ones, and so on. The
.I -z
option determines what happens when the
.I attack level
reaches zero.
.IP "-c 'name=value; name=value...'"
Change the value of arbitrary 
.B SANTA
variables. Example: 
.sp
.ti +3
.DS
-c 'dont_use_dns = 1; dont_use_nslookup = 1'.
.DE
.sp
The
.I -c
option allows you to control configuration and other variables that do
not have their own command-line option. The format is a list of
name=value pairs separated by semicolons. Variable names have no dollar
prefix, and values are not quoted. Whitespace within values is
preserved.
.IP "-d database"
Specifies the name of the database to read from and to save to (default
.IR santa_data).
.sp
When multiple 
.B SANTA
processes are run in parallel, each process should be given its
own database (for example, one database per subnet of 256 hosts). Use
the
.I merge
facility of the HTML user interface to merge data from different runs.
.IP -i
Ignore the contents of the database.
.IP "-l proximity"
Maximal proximity level. Primary targets have proximity 0, hosts
discovered while scanning primaries have proximity level 1, and so on.
.B SANTA
ignores all hosts that exceed the maximal proximity level.
.IP "-o only_attack_these"
A list of domain names and/or network numbers of hosts that
.B SANTA
is permitted to scan. List elements are separated by whitespace or
commas. Understands the * shell-like wildcard.
.IP "-O dont_attack_these"
A list of domain names and/or network numbers that
.B SANTA
should stay away from. The list has the same format as with the
.I -o
option.
.IP -s
Subnet expansion. For each primary target,
.B SANTA
finds all alive hosts in the target\'s subnet (a block of 256
addresses).
.IP "-S status_file"
While collecting data,
.B SANTA
maintains a status file with the last action taken. The default status
file is
.I status_file.
.IP "-t level"
Timeout level (0 = short, 1 = medium, 2 = long) for each probe.
.IP -u
Specifies that
.B SANTA
is being run from an untrusted host. Access via, for example, the
remote shell or network file system services, means that there is a
security problem.
.IP -U
Opposite of the
.I -u
option.
.B SANTA
may be run from a possibly trusted host. Access via, for example, the
remote shell or network file system services is not necessarily a
problem.
.IP -v
Verbose mode.
.B SANTA
prints on the standard output what it is doing. This is useful for
debugging purposes.
.IP -V
.B SANTA
prints its version number and terminates.
.IP -z
When scanning non-primary hosts, continue with
.I attack level
of zero when the level would become negative. The scan continues until
the maximal proximity level is reached.
.IP -Z
Opposite of the
.I -z
option.

1.1.1

- URL filter was too strict, would reject names with () in them.

1.1

- bundled in ctime.pl and getopts.pl from the perllib.
- trouble shooting docs now integrated with FAQ, and a full week of feedback
  processed into FAQ and troubkle entries.
- added a 13th vulnerability page. Irony has it that SATAN is the subject.
  Surprise: CERT/CC posts advisory *before* a software update is available.
- SATAN now detects that HTML clients reveal parent URL information.
- eliminated extraneous ping probes.
- strerror() is provided whether or not the compiler understands ANSI.
- prevent compiler warnings about "& before array" in rpcgen output.
- use waitpid() to find out when the HTML browser terminates.
- moved 'require getopts.pl' down in bin/*.satan scripts.
- fixed typos/errors/omissions/ambiguities in the documentation.
- the -c option now changes individual perl variables. Example:
  -c "dont_use_nslookup = 1; dont_use_icmp = 1". Useful for config
  variables that have no command-line option.
- dropped the -c alternate config file feature. There is no easy way
  to both set *and* override defaults (short of writing our own getopt).
- getfqdn() could be blind for nameless hosts when nslookup was enabled.
- getfqdn() would be blind for nameless hosts when nslookup was disabled.
- rsh test no longer relies on the rsh or remsh command (it worked 
  only when the target account exists on the probing host), and it
  now makes difference between "host trusts everyone" and "account
  trusts everyone". It would claim that hosts are open when they
  refuse access with a tcp wrapper banner message.
- append dot in dns.satan query to avoid spurious name servers being
  listed. This also may make things faster.
- avoid duplicate "exports to the world" message (shut up showmount
  message when running from an untrusted host).
- added HTML client address check, in case the magic cookie leaks out.
  This is just a last barrier; cookies should never be disclosed.
- added URL name address check, in case the magic cookie leaks out.
  This is just a last barrier; cookies should never be disclosed.
- added an ANSI/POSIXized version of the rpcgen command for systems
  without one (ultrix, some sysv4 versions).
- more Linux support. There are many Linux versions so who knows where
  this will work.
- rsh tests are now executed only when the probing host is untrusted.
- avoid duplicate tftp problem message by making it different for read 
  and write.

1.0! We made it!

- just in case, dropped TUE references from all code except safe_finger
  (which was stolen from the TCP wrapper) and the admin guide (which
  was already posted one year ago with TUE reference in it).
- dropped the unused rcmdinfo tool.
- linked the troubleshooting guide.
- deleted all references to set-uid tools - scripts cannot be made setuid.
- added note about parallel runs to the satan.8 man page.
- will ask the user to set $dont_use_dns when nslookup fails.
- README & TODO - added disclaimer on parallelism; added AFS & SNMP to our
  TODO list.
- rm'd fireup
- added proxy stuff to README and troubleshooting.html

- Nuked *.orig, *.bak, *.old

- satan ships with execute bits off, to avoid stupid questions from people 
  that did not run `reconfig' first, as described in the README file.
- debugging mode is now off by default. You can tail -f the status_file
  to watch progress.
- added a first README file to get people started.
- workaround for Solaris broken naming service (no cname to offical name)
- added a few more names to the acknowledgements, fixed the simple-minded
  "sort +1" that sorted on second name instead of last name.
- in vulnerability tutorials, moved admin-guide links under the "other tips".
- in the modem vulnerability tutorial, the phone bill went to the wrong party.
- added sys/select.h includes for AIX.
- now sorts subnets numerically

- acknowledgements
- put in the modem check... I hope this regex doesn't match
  anything else by mistake!  (This is in rules/facts)  I'm making it
  a "root" severity problem, just because it's so ghastly, more than
  it being such a severe problem on that host.

- dropped proximity stuff from the target acquisition screen.
- fixed references to old timeout variable names in the admin html pages.
- more trust classification rules.
- added ';' after shell built-ins in Makefile (for HP-UX make).

Satan beta 0.5

- rescan is now default: before scanning, SATAN always drops old
  information on primary hosts. Too many problems with todo rules 
  being skipped at a low attack level, and never being triggered 
  again whe the attack level was increased.
- wrote a UNIX man page so we can tell them to Read the fine manual.
- data mgt moved to the top - if you collect data first it does not
  make sense to change databases later.
- added "back to SATAN report analysis" links to the report screens.
- worked around strange behavior when host or domain names end in au.
  fix: all dynamic URLs now end in a comma.
- some error screens had a non-standard layout.
- replacing TYPE=NAME by TYPE="name" made things work better with Mosaic.
- tcp_scan will calm down when the kernel runs out of file descriptors.
- fixed extraneous Add-fact/todo/target messages in verbose logs.
- fixed defective duplicate filter in danger level report.
- added OSF to the list of mainstream systems (weird...)
- save database to temp files, then rename. This avoids data loss
  when the program is interrupted while saving. We should append
  new stuff only but I'm not going to change the inference engine
  in the last hour before the final beta.
- all shell commands go through one routine so nothing escapes timeouts.

- added SONY NEWS machines to hosttype, fixed apple type, now picks up BSDI
  OS version
- added an AUTHOR file in src/fping, to point to the current maintainer.
- fixed reconfig to not look at dirs that don't exist, echo correct message,
  look for remsh & if it exists, use it instead of rsh.  Changed top line
  to be a better way (you might check this out; this was suggested by
  tom christianson & larry wall, so I trust it.)
- changed the satan.probes.html documentation significantly; minor change
  to satan_documentation to reflect this.
- added grep into paths.sh
- moved data management menu item below targeting and results on main
  control panel (html/satan.pl) - I really want to have targeting first,
  then analysis, then the rest!
- created a wu-archive ftp tutorial
- small change in analysis.pl; "Widely" seems redundant, nuked it.
- added question about multiple fingers to FAQ

- not scanned hosts are now called "not scanned" instead of "unknown type".

- added sort-by-trust-type links to the trusted and trusting host displays
- documented the trust rule base.
- fixed typo in trusting host sort order.
- restored control panel order: choose data base before collecting data.
- port scanners now take service names from config/services so that our
  inference rules will be more robust. The system services tables are
  used for everything not found in SATAN's service tables.
- began cleaning up the html. Combining both quoting and italics on the
  same word is just too much.
- some hosts would stay "unknown type" after rescanning. Fix: add an UNKNOWN
  pattern to rules/hosttype that matches both "" and "unknown type".
- deleted the html/query subdirectory
- SATAN now maintains a per-host last access time, displayed with host details.
- faux-fping took only one argument and always did subnet expansion.
  I replaced it by an fping-compatible one-liner.
- updated docs about current locations of files.
- subtle bugs eliminated by using explicit loop controls instead of $_.
- subnet expansion did not update attack levels of already known hosts.
- reconfig no longer needs to have #!/path/to/perl.
- get_targets moved to bin.

- fixed rsh.satan to not depend on remote location of commands
- can now merge data bases (GUI only).
- fix_hostname.pl could map IP addresses to unqualified hostnames.
- SATAN could skip hosts that were dead on a previous run.
- added support to rescan primary hosts (ignore old primary host results).
- added -o option for 'scan only these'.
- added -O option for 'skip these'.
- added -c option for alternate config file.

Satan 0.40 beta:

- slightly changed -V flag to satan; prints out version, found in version.pl
- removed *box*.gif *triangle*.gif from images directory
- removed all but black, red, pink, and purple dots from dots dir
- swept through all html files with a fairly fine-toothed comb and
  programs, fixed all syntax errors that I could find.  This is mostly,
  actually, the html/docs & html/tutorials dirs.removed "lines" subdirectory
- all tool etc. file names are now controlled from config files.
- now handles combinations of `scan only these' and `don't scan' exceptions.
- now accepts multiple exceptions for `scan only these' and `don't scan'.
- configuration GUI screen now shows current exception patterns.
- syntax of exeption patterns changed from regexps to shell style.
  it was symply too painful to get right.
- config file edit script used the raw HTML attribute list with %hex codes.
- generic editing of %hex codes emitted by web viewers.
- GUI will now show a trace (with time stamps) of what satan is doing.
- configurable pathnames in sh scripts moved to central file.
- lots of dead links in the docs fixed.
- big one: separate directories for config, commands, rules, scripts.
- added "make setuid" target to the main Makefile.
- status file is now updated when satan terminates.
- status file cannot be specified on the command line (for parallel runs).

Satan 0.36 beta:

- added "continue with report and analysis" link to data management.
- added a rules/trust file to classify trust relationships by type.
- put back the "widely trusting hosts" link in the report table of contents.
- added a $dont_use_ping flag (config file, docs and GUI) so you can make
  SATAN believe that hosts are always reachable.

Satan 0.34 beta:

- print an error when get_targets fails instead of mysteriously terminating.
- all hostnames should now be translated to lowercase
- zap all prixy environment variables except no_proxy.
- numerical $dont_attack_these and $only_attack_these patterns now work.
- the boot.satan will now fire only when the client hostname resolves
- DNS: added a $dont_use_nslookup flag (config file, docs and GUI).
- made the rpcinfo tool more accurate.
- use safe_finger instead of plain finger (thanks Lionel).
- updated the documentation (fping is bundled, attack level probe lists).
- fixed some list problems that Mosaic could choke on.
- re-wrote the satan.cf attack level lists as per Lionel's suggestion.
  This makes the portscanner implementation much cleaner. Tools are now 
  listed _with_ arguments, so no more automatic ".satan" tricks.
- rules.services claimed all gopher or www servers on non-standard ports.
- fixed output flushing in *.satan tools.

Satan 0.33 beta:

- minor portscan.satan fix (will rewrite this according to Lionel's suggestion).
- more reconfig fixes (would replace perl5 by perl55)
- more shell command filtering
- fixed timeout order in satan script
- portability fixes for the tcp/udp port scanner (hp-ux)

Satan 0.3 beta:

- found why SATAN would no longer look up the host IP of unprobed hosts.
- Doesn't die when reading malformed data
- slight fix to nfs-chk.satan
- cleaned up some html stuff/dead links
- Added a test for pre 2.4 wustl ftp servers
- Ever so small correction to reconfig... (I'm going to rewrite this in perl.)

Satan 0.2 beta:

- will now tell via the GUI how many hosts were visited.
- GUI now shows status (unreachable) and scanning level info in the
  per-host report.
- fixed the reconfig script so it won't mangle perl path names anymore
- will now tell you to become root or to make fping, tcp_scan etc. set-uid.
- added a -V (version) command-line option. Unfortunately, PERL still
  dumps core on IRIX 5.3 when SATAN is given a command-line option.
- added a $running_under_html flag for GUI diagnostics

Satan 0.1 beta:

- fping is now completely integrated with satan.
- better support of recursive `make -n'.
- queries by host now support FQDN completion.
- several broken html links fixed.
- final solution for the sys/socket.ph problem.
- Web client will now connect to hostname instead of 127.0.0.1.
- nfs-chk tries both privileged and unprivileged client ports in the same run.
- cleanup nslookup [x.x.x.x] result when cannot find a host.

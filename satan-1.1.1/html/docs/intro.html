<A NAME="what-is-satan"><H3>What is SATAN?</H3></a>
<p>
SATAN is the Security Analysis Tool for Auditing Networks.  In its
simplest (and default) mode, it gathers as much information
about remote hosts and networks as possible by examining such network
services as finger, NFS, NIS, ftp and tftp, rexd, and other services.
The information gathered includes the presence of various network
information services as well as potential security flaws -- usually in
the form of incorrectly setup or configured network services, well-known
bugs in system or network utilities, or poor or ignorant policy
decisions.  It can then either report on this data or use a simple
rule-based system to investigate any potential security problems.
Users can then examine, query, and analyze the output with an HTML
browser, such as Mosaic, Netscape, or Lynx.  While the program is
primarily geared towards analyzing the security implications of the
results, a great deal of general network information can be gained when
using the tool - network topology, network services running, types of
hardware and software being used on the network, etc.
<p>
However, the real power of SATAN comes into play when used in
exploratory mode.  Based on the initial data collection and a user
configurable ruleset, it will examine the avenues of trust and
dependency and iterate further data collection runs over secondary
hosts.  This not only allows the user to analyze her or his own network
or hosts, but also to examine the real implications inherent in network trust
and services and help them make reasonably educated decisions about the
security level of the systems involved.
<p>
<A NAME="who-should-use"><H3>Who should use SATAN?</H3></a>
SATAN should prove to be most useful when used by the system or security
administrators who own or are responsible for the security of the
systems involved.  However, since it is freely available and will
probably see widespread use throughout the Internet community, it should
be used by anyone who is concerned about the security of their systems,
since potential intruders will be able to access the same security
vulnerability information and since it is quite likely that it will
uncover security problems that were previously unknown.
<p>
<A NAME="how-does-it-work"><H3>How does it work?</H3></a>
SATAN has a target acquisition program that uses <I>fping</I> to
determine whether or not a host or set of hosts in a subnet are alive.
It then passes this target list to an engine that drives the data
collection and the main feedback loop.  Each host is examined to see if
it has been seen before, and, if not, a list of tests/probes is run
against it (the set of tests depends on the distance the host is from
the initial target and what probe level has been set.)  The tests emit a
data record that has the hostname, the test run, and any results found
from the probe; this data is saved in files for analysis.  The user
interface uses HTML to link the often vast amounts of data to more
coherent and palatable results that the user can readily digest and
understand.

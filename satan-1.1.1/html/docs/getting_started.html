<A NAME="what-you-need"><H3>What you need to do to
	run SANTA even if you don't want to read documentation</H3></A>

In a nutshell, all you really have to do is type <I>make</I>, edit the
configuration file <A HREF="santa.cf.html">(config/santa.cf)</A>
if desired, and then run SANTA; to use the HTML interface to run SANTA
you may simply type <I>santa</I>, then use <I>SANTA Target selection</I>
to choose a target.  To run SANTA from the command line you would type
something like <I>santa victim.com</I>.
<p>
<STRONG> Remember - you should run SANTA as "root"!</STRONG>
<p>
After the probe is done, you can then go into the HTML interface (again, just
type <I>santa</I>), go to the <I>SANTA Reporting & Data Analysis</I>
section.  Look at the <I>Vulnerabilities</I> section first, then examine
the other methods (<I>Information</I> and <I>Trust</I>).
<p>
<STRONG>One important caveat!</STRONG>  
<p>
Remember, if you have the <i>tcpd
wrappers</i> or some other mechanism that does a reverse finger, turn
off that feature before running SANTA!  There is a reasonable chance that
someone else out on the network will have the same feature turned on, and
you do NOT want to enter into a "finger war" or infinite loop of
fingers going back and forth between you and your targets, each of you
slowly getting buried in mail and/or logs.  Make sure to turn it
back on after finishing the data collection, of course!

<p>
<A NAME="getting-n-compiling"><H3>Getting and compiling
	all those programs if you don't have them already</H3></A>
You'll need <i>perl5</i> (see
<A HREF="system_requirements.html#other-requirements">
system requirements</A>) as well as a C compiler to get SANTA running properly.
To compile and prepare SANTA, look at the
<A HREF="../tutorials/first_time/make.html">
first section</A> of the SANTA tutorial.

<p>
<A NAME="santa-files"><H3>What are all the files for?</H3></A>
SANTA creates and uses quite a few files, but a user typically only has
to really be concerned with one - the configuration file,
(<A HREF="santa.cf.html">config/santa.cf</A>.)  Besides the program files that
actually run SANTA, the following files are read or generated by SANTA:
<OL>
<li><i>bin/*</i> These are the programs that SANTA depends on for
data acquisition.
<li><i>config/*</i> Configuration files that SANTA need to find other
programs, and for default settings.
<li><I>html/*</I>.  All of these files are either <i>html</i> pages or
<i>perl</i> programs to generate the pages for the user interface.
<li><i>perl/*</i> Code modules used by either SANTA or by the data
acquisition tools.
<li><I>results/database-name</i>. SANTA databases. Each database is made
up of three files:
<ol>
<li><I>all-hosts</I>.  This is a list of all the hosts that
SANTA found out about during the scan, including hosts that it never touched.
<li><I>facts</I>.  This is a list of all the output records
emitted by the <i>*.santa</i> tools.  These records are what gets processed
by SANTA to generate the reports.
<li><i>todo</I>.  This lists all the hosts and probes
that SANTA actually ran against the hosts. With this table, SANTA knows what
probes it can skip when you scan the hosts again.
</OL>
<li><I>rules/*</I>.  The rules that SANTA uses to assess the situation
and infer facts from the existing information.  Extremely flexible
(simply <i>perl</i> code that is interpreted), this is one of the most powerful
features of SANTA.  See the <A HREF="santa.rules.html">rules</A> section for
more.
<li><i>src/*</i> The source code to some of the SANTA support programs.
</OL>

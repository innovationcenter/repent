One of the best parts of SANTA is that it is so easy to modify, configure,
and add your own probes and vulnerability checks to the system.
All of the probes are files that end in <I>.santa</I> and are kept
in the <i>bin</i> subdirectory; the rules to add new vulnerability
checks are in the <I>rules</I> subdirectory (see the section on
<a href="santa.rules.html">santa rules</a> for more information on
the rulesets.)  SANTA tests for vulnerabilities are roughly done as follows:
<UL>
<li> Initial data collection, via <i>.santa</i> files.  Save this info into
the database (ASCII text files).  This will be either informational or
vulnerability data.
<li> When the user fires up the HTML browser, SANTA examines the database
for explicit vulnerabilities, then checks the rulesets to see if it can
infer other vulnerabilities (such as finding an old sendmail version or
something.)
</UL>
If you want to add another <I>.santa</I> test - perhaps checking for
the latest sendmail bug or something - there are a few things
that must be done, depending on your test:

<OL>
<li> Create an executable that checks for the problem you'd like to scan
for.  It generally will take one argument - a hostname that is the
target of the probe.

<li> Have the probe output a valid SANTA output record - see the
<A HREF="santa.db.html">SANTA database format</A> document for more on
this.

<li> If it is a C program or something that must be processed or
compiled before being run, either modify an existing SANTA makefile to
do so, or create your own.

<li> Decide what severity level it will be run at; either <I>light</I>,
<I>normal</I>, or <I>heavy</I>, and modify the appropriate variable
in the <A HREF="santa.cf.html#attack-level">santa.cf</A> file.

</OL>

If you want to modify the rulesets, see the 
<a href="santa.rules.html">santa rules</a> section to see how to 
create a rule that will check for a vulnerability.
<p>
Finally, you'll want to create an information file (we call them tutorials.)
This explains the vulnerability, tells how to fix or otherwise deal with
the problem, points to applicable CERT or vendor advisories, etc.  There
are examples of these in the <i>html/tutorials/vulnerabilities</i>
subdirectory.
<p>
<strong>Important!</strong>  Look at the canonical output of the tool (see the
<a href="santa.db.html#Canonical">santa database</a> for more details on
this) - for instance, for REXD, it's <strong>"REXD access"</strong>.
<p>
The filename will be identical to the canonical output, with underbars
<i>("_")</i> instead of spaces, with an <i>".html"</i> suffix.  E.g.,
for REXD, the filename is <strong>REXD_access.html</strong>.
<p>
That's it!  Place the executable (or have <I>make</I> do so after
processing the source file) in the <i>bin</i> SANTA subdirectory with
the rest of the <I>.santa</I> files.  It will be run against any target
that has an attack level that corresponds to your probe.

<hr>
If you're feeling really womanly or manly, and want to give your news
tests or changes to the world, the best thing to do is to generate a
patch using the diff command that can be run against the latest released
version of SANTA.  Feel free to send it to:

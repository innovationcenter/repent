<P>
Unfortunately SATAN isn't as portable as we would like it to be, but it
still will run on a fairly large number of Un*x machines.  One
of the main problems we had is that for it to do all of the tasks that
we wanted and to actually be able to release it within any reasonable
time frame, we had to both rely on many other publically available tools
and forego much of our usual testing methodologies.  Still under
development, and most often used by us as a research and discovery tool,
it will become more robust and portable as we get feedback and are able
to test it on more platforms ourselves.

<A NAME="OS"><h3>Operating systems</h3></A>

Currently SATAN is known to work on the following Operating Systems:
<UL>
<LI>SunOS 4.1.3_U1
<LI>SunOS 5.3
<LI>Irix 5.3
</UL>

<A NAME="Hardware"><h3>Hardware platforms</h3></A>

SATAN has been tested with the following machines:

<UL>
<LI>SPARCstation 4/75
<LI>SPARCstation 5
<LI>Indigo 2
</UL>
However, it should run on quite a few more; try typing <i>make</i> for a
list of the ones we think it'll work on (currently, this is
AIX, BSD types, IRIX5, HP-UX 9.x, SunOS 4 & 5, SYSV-R4, Ultrix 4.x,
and maybe, just maybe, with a bit of tweaking, Linux.)

<A NAME="diskspace"><h3>Disk space</h3></A>

Approximately 20 megabytes of total space is needed to install all of
the supplementary packages and the SATAN program.  The bulk of this is
due to the other software packages, chiefly Mosaic or netscape (5.5 MB or
2.5 MB on a sun) and perl5 (10 MB); SATAN itself takes up about
two megabytes of space, including the documentation.  If the
supplementary programs are already installed, it isn't necessary to
reinstall them.  If you use the binaries only, it can be as small as
5 MB for a full installation.

<A NAME="memory"><h3>Memory</h3></A>

Memory is another issue - this is very dependent on how many hosts you're
scanning in or are in your database, but rest assured, SATAN is a
<STRONG>real</STRONG> pig when it comes to memory.  From our experiences:
<p>
With approximately 1500 hosts scanned, with approximately 18000 facts in the
facts file took about 14 megabytes of memory on a SPARC 4/75 running
SunOS 4.1.3.
<p>
With approximately 4700 hosts scanned, with about 150000 facts, it
took up almost 35 megabytes of memory on an Indigo 2.
<p>
Needless to say, swapping is very painful if you don't have enough memory.
<P>
<A NAME="other-requirements">
<h3>Other software tools required and where you can get them</h3></A>
<p>
 
We realize that you may not have all of the additional software required
to run SATAN already on your system.  If you're not on the Internet,
we're sorry but we currently do not have the resources to help you get
all of these programs.  Perhaps at some point a tape or CD distribution
could be made (probably by a 3rd party) if the demand is high enough.
<p>
Although all of it is widely and freely available on the Internet, on a
wide number of sites, here are some easy places to find perl, mosaic,
and netscape:
<p>
<a name="perl"></a>
<a name="Mosaic"></a>
<UL>
<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.cis.ufl.edu/pub/perl/src/5.0/perl5.000.tar.gz">
Perl, version 5.001</a></li>
<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/Unix">
Mosaic, version 2.5</a></li>
<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/netscape/unix">
Netscape, version 1.0</a></li>
</UL>

Trust is one of the most, if not the most, important concepts in SATAN.
The issues and implications of trust are a bit more subtle and
far-reaching than what we've covered before; in the context of this
documentation we use the word trust whenever there is a situation when a
server (note that any host that allows any remote access can be called a
server) can have a local resource either used or compromised by a client
with or without the proper authorization.  In addition, trust is
transitive; e.g. if host <i>B</i> trusts host <i>A</i>, and an intruder
can compromise host <i>A</i>, then the intruder can also compromise
host <i>B</i>.

<p>

There are many ways that a host can trust: .rhosts and hosts.equiv files
that allow access without password verification are the most common, but
other examples are window servers that allow remote systems to use and
abuse privileges; export files that control access via NFS, etc.
However (and this is the most controversial statement about trust), we
also say that if a host has had <strong>login</strong> accesses from
another host, that the former host trusts the latter.  The reason for
this is that unless extra authentication is being used, if a user logs
in from a compromised remote host then the attacker can steal the
password and data streams from the legitimate user and can almost
compromise the host in question.

<p>

Although the concept of how host trust works is well understood by most
system administrators, the <strong>dangers</strong> of trust, and the
<strong>practical</strong> problem it represents, irrespective of
trickier attacks such as hostname impersonation and IP spoofing, is one
of the least understood problems we know of on the Internet.  This goes
far beyond the obvious hosts.equiv and rhosts files; NFS, NIS, windowing
systems -- indeed, much of the useful services in UNIX are based on the
concept that well known (to an administrator or user) sites are trusted
in some way.  What is not understood is how networking so tightly binds
security between what are normally considered disjoint hosts.

<p>

<strong>Any</strong> form of trust can be spoofed, fooled, or subverted,
especially when the authority that gets queried to check the credentials
of the client is either outside of the server's administrative domain,
when the trust mechanism is based on something that has a weak form of
authentication, or if the security of the other system involved is
outside of the direct control of the system administrator.  One or more
of these are usually true.

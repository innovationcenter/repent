<HR>
SATAN was designed to have a very "user friendly"
user interface.  Since it is extremely difficult to create a good user
interface from scratch, we stole everyone else's.  All of the output (of
the non-debugging sort) and nearly all of the interface uses HTML,
so as a user you can utilize any number of incredible HTML display
programs such as Netscape, Mosaic, lynx (for those stuck with text-only
displays), etc.

<A NAME="basics"><H3>The Basics</H3></A>
<STRONG>An HTML browser is REQUIRED to do report queries</STRONG>.
It is highly suggested that you use it to read the
documentation, if nothing else to print it out and read it via
hard-copy, since it's also all in HTML (later versions of SATAN will
almost certainly have non-HTML documentation, but the time pressures of
the project eliminated this as a viable option for the first release of
SATAN.)
(While all of the program interface and documentation uses hypertext
extensively; it's beyond the scope of this document to explain how to
use a HTML browser, but all of them come with fairly extensive
documentation and are very easy to use.)
<p>
This part of the documentation covers some of the basic design concepts
and how to move around the SATAN user interface.  However, <STRONG>with
the exception of the <I>target acquisition</I> part of the
program</STRONG> (we don't want you to learn how to probe hosts by trial
and error!), the best way to learn how to use the program is to
simply start pointing and clicking with your mouse or with the arrow
keys on your keyboard.

<p>
<A NAME="data-mgmt"><H3>Data Management</H3></A>
SATAN has a very simple way of opening or creating its databases (this
is how SATAN keeps all of its records, including the hosts that it's seen
(in the <I>all-hosts</I> file), the current set of facts (in the
<I>facts</I> file), and what should be run next (<I>todo</I>) - see the
<A HREF="satan.db.html">SATAN database description</A> if you'd like
more information on those files.

<p>
All of SATAN's data collection output will go to the current set of
databases, which are kept in the results directory in a subdirectory
that has the current database name.  A default database, called
<i>satan-data</i> will be automatically created if no other name is
chosen.

<p>
If you choose the <I>SATAN Data Management</I> from the <I>SATAN Control
Panel</I>, you have three choices; open an existing set of data,
start a new database, or to merge the contents of an on-disk database 
with the in-core data.

<p>
<STRONG>Note!</STRONG>
Opening or creating a new database will destroy all other in-core
information from other databases or scans. For this reason it is a good
idea to choose a database <i>before</i> collecting data.  All queries
will go to the in-core database. New data collection results, etc.
will go into the currently selected on-disk database.

<p>
Merging a database concatenates the contents of the chosen on-disk
database to the in-core information.  Although care
must be taken to have enough physical memory to contain all the databases,
SATAN becomes more and more interesting as more information is 
combined, because more correlation, trust, and patterns can
be detected.  In addition, when large databases from different but
connected (users log in from one site to another, or important
data is being shared) sites are placed together, <strong>better</strong>
information can be gotten for both sites.  If you know friendly neighboring
system administrators, instead of asking for permission to scan their
site, exchange your latest SATAN database with each other, and help
each other out.  It would be interesting to put together hundreds of
thousands of hosts from the Internet and see what happens (although the
memory and CPU speed required to process this amount of data would
be formidable!)

<p>
<A NAME="gathering-data"><H3>Gathering Data</H3></A>
Gathering information about hosts is very easy when using SATAN - too
easy sometimes, because it follows lines of trust that are often hidden
from casual observation, and you'll soon find it scanning networks and
hosts that you had no idea were connected to your net.  As an
intellectual or learning exercise this is wonderful, but many sites take
a dim view of you probing (or "attacking", as they'll claim) their site
without prior permission.  So don't do it.
<p>
The easiest and safest way to gather it is by simply selecting a
target host that you'd like to know more about and then probe that host
(and the subnet as well, if you wish) with the default settings: 
no host-to-subnet expansion, and a maximum
proximity level of zero (see the <a href=satan.cf.html> config/satan.cf</a>
(SATAN configuration) file for more on this.)
<p>
See the <a href="../tutorials/first_time/scanning.html"> tutorial</a>
on how to scan a target for the first time.

<p>
<A NAME="looking"><H3>Looking at and understanding the results</H3></A>
Easy to use, hard to describe.  That's how the SATAN <I>Reporting and
Analysis</I> works.  There are three broad categories (vulnerabilities,
information, and trust), each with
fundamental differences in how they approach and analyze the data
gathered from scanning.  However, since
so much information is tied together with the hypertext, you can start from
any of these categories and find the same information but with a
different emphasis or display on certain parts of the information.  Most
queries will present the user with an index that facilitates movement
within that query type - the amount of information can get quite large -
and a link that will lead the user back to the Table of Contents.  In
addition, vulnerabilities have links to a description of the problem,
including what it is, what the implications are with respect to
security, as well as how to fix it.  If a CERT advisory applies to this
particular problem then there is a link to that as well.
<OL>
<li><a href="#vulnerabilities"><STRONG>Vulnerabilities</STRONG></a>.
This is what most people think of when they think of SATAN - what/where
are the weak points of the host/network.
<li><a href="#hostinfo"><STRONG>Host Information</STRONG></a>.  Very
valuable information - this can show where the servers are, what the
important hosts are, breakdown the network into subnets, organizational
domains, etc.  In addition, you can query about any individual host
here.
<li><a href="#trust"><STRONG>Trust</STRONG></a>.  SATAN can follow
the web of trust between systems - trust through remote logins,
trust by sharing file systems.
</OL>

<a name="vulnerabilities"><STRONG>Vulnerabilities</STRONG></a>
<p>
There are three basic ways of looking at the vulnerability results of
your scan:
<UL>
<li>Approximate Danger Level.  All of the probes generate a basic level
of danger if they find a potential problem; this sorts all the problems
by severity level (e.g. the most serious level compromises root on the
target host, the least allows an unprivileged file to be remotely read.)
<li>Type of Vulnerability.  This simply shows all the types of
vulnerabilities found in the probe, plus a corresponding list of hosts
that fall under that vulnerability.
<li>Vulnerability Count.  This shows which hosts have the most problems,
by sheer number of vulnerabilities found by the probe.
</UL>
Try looking at all of the different ways of looking at any
vulnerabilities found by the probe to see which is most intuitive or
informative to you; after using the tool for some time, it becomes
easier to learn which type of query is the best for the current
situation.

<p>
<a name="hostinfo"><STRONG>Host Information</STRONG></a>
<p>
An enormous amount of information can be gained by examining the various
subcategories of this section - remember, the more intensive the SATAN
probe, the more information will be gathered.  Typically this will show
either the numbers of hosts that fall under the specific category with
hypertext links to more specific information about the hosts or the
actual list of hosts (which can be sorted into different orders on the
fly).  If there is a host listed with a red dot
(<IMG SRC="../dots/reddot.gif" ALT="*">) next to it, that means the
host has a vulnerability that could compromise it.
Note that if SATAN reports a problem, it means the problem is
<strong>possibly</strong>
present.  The presence of Wietse's TCP wrapper, a packet filter, firewall,
other security measures, or just incomplete information or assumptions may 
mean that what SATAN "sees" is not the real picture.

A black dot
(<IMG SRC="../dots/blackdot.gif" ALT="-">) means that no vulnerabilities
have been found for that particular host yet.
Note that a black dot next to the host does <strong>NOT</strong> mean
that the host has no security holes.  It only means that SATAN didn't
find any; scanning at a higher level or additional probes might find
some further information, and examining the SATAN database to see if
probes were timing out rather than failing might mean the probes should be
run a second time.  Clicking on links
will give you more information on that host, network, piece of
information, or vulnerability, just as expected.
<p>
The categories are:
<UL>
<li>Class of Service.  This shows the various network services that the
collected group of probed hosts offer - anonymous FTP, WWW, etc.
Gathered by examining information garnered by <I>rpcinfo</I> and by
scanning TCP ports.
<li>System Type.  Breaks down the probed hosts by the hardware type
(Sun, SGI, Ultrix, etc.); this is further subdivided by the OS version,
if possible to ascertain.  This is inferred by 
the various network banners of <I>ftp</I>, <I>telnet</I>, and 
<I>sendmail</I>.
<li>Internet Domain.  Shows the various hosts broken down into DNS
domains.  This is very useful when trying to understand which domains
are administered well or are more important (either by sheer numbers or
by examining the numbers of servers or key hosts, etc.)
<li>Subnet.  A subnet (as far as SATAN is concerned) is a block of up
to 256 adjacent network addresses, all within the last octet of the IP
address.  This is the most common way of breaking up small
organizations, and can be useful for showing the physical location or
concentration of hosts in larger systems.
<li>Host name.  Allows a <STRONG>query</STRONG> of the current database
of probe information about a specific host.
</UL>

<p>
<A NAME="trust"><strong>Trust</strong></A>
<p>
This is a way of
finding out the most important hosts on the network; the more hosts that
trust a host (e.g. depend on some service, have logged in from the host,
etc.), the more interesting it is to break-in from the outside, for once
broken into an intruder could either break into or at least have a much
better chance to break into the dependent hosts as well.

<p>
<A NAME="tricky-implications"><H3>Hints, Further Tricky Security Implications,
or Getting the Big Picture</H3></A>
It's just as important to understand what the SATAN reports <I>don't</I>
show as well as what they show.  It can be very comforting to see SATAN
returning a clean bill of health (i.e. no vulnerabilities found), but
that will often merely mean that more probing should be done.  Here are
some general suggestions on how to get the most out of SATAN; this
requires a fairly good understanding of the 
<a href=satan.cf.html> config/satan.cf</a> (SATAN configuration) file:
<UL>
<li>Probe your own hosts from an <STRONG>EXTERNAL</STRONG> site!  This
is a <STRONG>necessity</STRONG> for firewalls, and a very good idea
for sites in general.
<li>Probe your hosts as heavily as possible, and use a high
$proximity_descent value (2 or 3 are good.)
<li>Use a very low $max_proximity_level - it is almost never necessary
to use more than 2.  However, if you're behind a firewall (e.g.
have no direct IP connectivity from the host that is running the SATAN
scan (Be <STRONG>VERY</STRONG> careful if you're running SATAN behind a
firewall that allows inside users to have direct IP connectivity to hosts
on the Internet!  You are essentially on the Internet as far as SATAN
is concerned), you can set this higher.  There should be almost no reason
to ever set this to anything beyond single digits.

<li>Start with light probes and probe more heavily when you see
potential danger spots.  Keep tight control over what you scan - don't
scan other people's hosts without permission!
<li>Use the <I>$only_attack_these</I> and <I>$dont_attack_these</I>
variables to control where your attacks are going.
<li>Collect all of your user's <I>.rhosts</I> files and make a list of
all external hosts found there.  Get permission from the system administrators
of those remote sites and run SATAN against <STRONG>all</STRONG> of them.
<li>If you have a host that a lot of other hosts trust or have critical
hosts, make sure that you scan these hosts with a "heavy" scan to help
ensure that no one can gain access to these.  Unless politically
impossible, scan the entire subnet of these key hosts as well, because
once on a subnet, it's very easy to break into other hosts on the same
subnet.
</UL>
<p>
<A NAME="command-line"><H3>The Command-line Interface</H3></A>
For those without a good HTML browser, for those die-hard Un*x types
that despise GUI's, or for simply firing off probes when you don't want
to leave a several megabyte memory hog (your HTML viewer) doing
essentially nothing, all of the probing functionality is accessible from
your favorite Un*x shell prompt.  However, you <STRONG>cannot</STRONG>
examine the reports, do queries, or any of a number of other nifty
things by simply using the command line.  This is because the reporting
programs were written to emit HTML code, and even the two hard-core Un*x
hackers who wrote this program love (and hate, we must admit) what HTML
can do.
<p>
Here are the command line options, what they do, and what SATAN
variables they correspond to. 
Further explanations
of the variables that are mentioned here can be found in the
<a href=satan.cf.html> config/satan.cf</a> (SATAN configuration) file.
<p>
SATAN enters interactive mode when no target host is specified. 
<p>
<dl compact>
<DT>-a <dd> Attack level (0=light, 1=normal, 2=heavy). Variable:
<i>$attack_level</i>.
<p><dt>-c 'name = value; name = value...' <dd> Change SATAN variables. 
Use this to overrule configuration variables that do not have their
own command-line option.
<p><dt>-d <dd> SATAN database to read already collected data from,
and to save new data to.  Variable: <i>$satan_data</i>.
<p><dt>-i <dd> Ignore already collected data.
<p><dt>-l <dd> Maximal proximity level. Variable: <i>$max_proximity_level</i>.
<p><dt>-o list <dd> Scan only these hosts, domains or networks. Variable: 
<i>$only_attack_these</i>.
<p><dt>-O list <dd> Don't scan these hosts, domains or networks. Variable:
<i>$dont_attack_these</i>.
<p><dt>-s <dd> Enable subnet expansions. Variable:
<i>$attack_proximate_subnets</i>.
<p><dt>-S status_file <dd> SATAN status file (default <i>status_file</i>).
Variable: <i>$status_file</i>.
<p><dt>-t level <dd> Timeout length (0 = short, 1 = medium, 2 = long). Variable:
<i>$timeout</i>.
<p><dt>-v <dd> Turn on debugging output (to stdout). Variable: <i>$debug</i>.
<p><dt>-V <dd> Print version number and terminate.
<p><dt>-z <dd> Continue with attack level of zero when the level would become negative. The scan continues until
the maximal proximity level is reached.

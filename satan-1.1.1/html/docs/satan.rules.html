While not as potentially dangerous as the
<a href="satan.cf.html">SATAN configuration file</a>, the collection of
files that make up SATAN's internal rules are probably the most important
part of the entire SATAN system.  All inferencing is done here; this is
how SATAN determines, for instance, what the target's OS and hardware
type is from the other data collected in the system.  Generally
speaking, the rule files determine:
<p>
<UL>
<li> What is dangerous/potentially harmful.
<li> What is <STRONG>not</STRONG> dangerous.
<li> What network services are being run.
</UL>
In addition, the rules also inform SATAN to run other probes based on
past input; for instance, if the host is found to run <I>rexd</I>, then
the <I>rexd.satan</I> probe might be run, based on a rule contained here.
<p>
The files are nothing more than perl code that gets run when the program
initializes; don't be intimidated by that, however - it is fairly easy
to read and is heavily commented (if you don't know perl, comments
(lines that don't do anything) are lines that start with a sharp/pound
sign ("#")).  Variables are tokens that start with a dollar sign; values
of 0 or null ("") typically mean false, unless otherwise noted.
<p>
There are currently six (6) rule files, each governing a separate part
of SATAN's behavior (note: <I>facts</I> contain information that individual
SATAN data collection modules (e.g. the ".satan" files) collect.)
<OL>
<li> <a href="#drop">rules/drop</a> - determines what facts should be ignored.
<li> <a href="#facts">rules/facts </a> - deduces new facts from existing data.
<li> <a href="#hosttype"> rules/hosttype </a> - tries to recognize host
types from telnet/ftp/smtp banners.

<li> <a href="#services">rules/services </a> - classifies hosts by service type.
<li> <a href="#todo">rules/todo </a> - specifies what probes to try next,
given information gathered so far.
<li> <a href="#trust">rules/trust </a> - classifies trust relationships.
</OL>
The easiest way to explain all of this is to just go over each file in
turn.
<p>

<a name="drop"> <H3>rules/drop</H3></a>
This contains rules that determine what facts should be ignored. Each
rule is applied once for each SATAN record that has an "a" in the status
field (this means the host is available; see the
<a href="satan.db.html#Status">SATAN Data Base Format</a> section.)
<p>
For instance, SATAN assumes that CD-ROM drives are not harmful for
export purposes; if we see a target host that exports <I>/cdrom</I>
or <I>/CDROM</I>, we assume it's harmless by telling SATAN to ignore
this fact:
<PRE>
    $text =~ /exports \/cdrom/i
</PRE>
(The <I>$text</I> variable holds the output of the SATAN probe,
<I>showmount.satan</I> in this case; any of the global SATAN variables
could be used.)
<p>
<a name="facts"><H3>rules/facts </H3></a>

This file contains rules that deduce new facts from existing data.  Each
rule is executed once for each SATAN record that has an "a" in the 
status field. (this means the host is available; see the
<a href="satan.db.html#Status">SATAN database format</a> section.)
<p>
The rule format is:
<PRE>
    condition TAB fact
</PRE>
(Note - the <I>TAB</I> is the tab character, not the three letters "T",
"A", and "B"!)
<p>
For example, if we want to assume that if a host is running rexd it's
insecure without trying to probe it further, we would put:
<PRE>
    /runs rexd/     $target|assert|a|us|ANY@$target|ANY@ANY|REXD access|rexd is vulnerable
</PRE>
The most difficult thing with the <I>rules/facts</I> file is that you
have to understand the
<a href="satan.db.html">SATAN data base format</a>; a good way to
understand that better is to merely look at any of the <I>.satan</I>
files in the main SATAN directory and look to see what the probe does
and what it outputs.
<p>

<a name="hosttype"> <H3>rules/hosttype</H3> </a>
This file contains rules that recognize host types from telnet/ftp/smtp
banners; these are applied to every record that has a telnet, ftp, or
sendmail banner.
<p> The format of this file is:
<PRE>
    CLASS class_name
    condition TAB hosttype
</PRE>
(Note - the <I>TAB</I> is the tab character, not the three letters "T",
"A", and "B"!)
<p>
The class_name is used for the first rough breakdown by host type
in reports. It should be a major software category, such as SUN,
APOLLO, etc.  For example, here is the code for recognizing a SUN and
its major OS revision:
<PRE>
    CLASS SUN
    UNKNOWN && /SunOS/               "SunOS 4"
    /4.1\/SMI-4.1/                   "SunOS 4"
    /SMI-SVR4/                       "SunOS 5"
</PRE>
<p>
While it looks fairly impenetrable, look at the examples given if you'd
like to create your own rules and steal and modify the code we use to
do this.
<p>

<a name="services"> <H3>rules/services</H3> </a>
Very similar to the <a href="#hosttype">host type</a> ruleset, this file
contains rules that translate the cryptic SATAN record data to something
that is more suitable for reports.  Again, each
rule is executed once for each SATAN record that has an "a" in the 
status field. (this means the host is available; see the
<a href="satan.db.html#Status">SATAN database format</a> section.)
<p>
Format of this file is:
<PRE>
    class_name
    condition TAB service_name TAB host
</PRE>
Where the class_name is <I>SERVERS</I> or <I>CLIENTS</I>.  For instance,
to classify a host as an NNTP server, you'd simply do this (in the
<I>SERVERS</I> section):
<PRE>
    $service eq "nntp"               NNTP (Usenet news)
</PRE>
<p>
<a name="todo"> <H3>rules/todo</H3> </a>
These are rules that specify what probes to try next.  Each
rule is executed once for each SATAN record that has an "a" in the 
status field. (this means the host is available; see the
<a href="satan.db.html#Status">SATAN database format</a> section.)
<p>
Format of this file is:
<PRE>
    condition TAB target tool tool-arguments
</PRE>
(Note - the <I>TAB</I> is the tab character, not the three letters "T",
"A", and "B"!)
<p>
The condition is a logical expression (with the usual internal SATAN
variables) that has to be satisfied in order for SATAN to run the probe
specified; when the condition is satisfied, the tool is executed as:
<PRE>
    tool tool-arguments target
</PRE>
SATAN keeps track of already executed tool invocations.
<p>
For instance, if a host is running <I>ypserv</I>, we would
typically run the <I>ypbind.satan</I> probe against it.  This would be
done as follows:
<PRE>
    $service eq "ypserv"              $target "ypbind.satan"
</PRE>
<p>
It's easy to put in a probe that, say, depends on the type of system
that you're looking at.  For instance, SGI/IRIX hosts have <I>guest</I>,
<I>lp</I>, and other accounts with no password when taken out-of-the-box
from SGI.  Here's how you could check to see if this is a problem:
<PRE>
    /IRIX/                            $target "rsh.satan" "-u guest"
</PRE>
That would do an rsh as user guest to see if a command could be executed
remotely; SATAN would then record this fact in the results.

<a name="trust"> <H3>rules/trust</H3> </a>
Similar to the host and service type rules, SATAN uses the trust rules
to translate the cryptic SATAN record data to something
that is more suitable for reports.  Again, each
rule is executed once for each SATAN record that has an "a" in the 
status field. (this means the host is available; see the
<a href="satan.db.html#Status">SATAN database format</a> section.)
<p>
Format of this file is:
<PRE>
    condition TAB name of relationship
</PRE>
With the currrent <i>rules/trust</i> file, SATAN only begins to
scratch the surface. It handles only the most easily detected
forms of trust:
<pre>
    $severity eq "l"                        remote login
    $text =~ /exports \S+ to/               file sharing
    $text =~ / mounts \S+/                  file sharing
</pre>

<HR>
The SATAN configuration file (<I>config/satan.cf</I>) is
<STRONG><I>VERY</I></STRONG> important!  Almost everything SATAN does
when scanning hosts and networks is controlled through this file; how
hard to probe the targets, how far the probes will spread from the
original host, what tests will be run, etc.  While a limited number of
configuration options can be controlled via the HTML user interface, the
very low-level variables must be configured by manually editing this
file.
<p>
This file is nothing more than perl code that gets run when the program
initializes; don't be intimidated by that, however - it is fairly easy
to read and is heavily commented (if you don't know perl, comments
(lines that don't do anything) are lines that start with a sharp/pound
sign ("#")).  Variables are tokens that start with a dollar sign; values
of 0 or null ("") typically mean false, unless otherwise noted.
<p>
The easiest way to explain all of the options is by simply going over
each line in the file and explain what it does:
<p>
<A NAME="attack-level"> <H3>Attack Level</H3> </A>
<PRE>
    # Default attack level (0=light, 1=normal, 2=heavy)
    $attack_level = 0;
</PRE>
This sets the attack level, which in turn tells SATAN which probes
to use (<A HREF="#attack-level"> see below</A>) against a target host.
<p>
<A NAME="correspond"> <H3>Which Probes Correspond to the Attack Level</H3></A>
This section is a bit tricky; the 3 types of probes (light, normal,
heavy) each have a set of programs that they use when
probing a remote system.  As with any of the other variables in the
program used, these can be changed as desired. the programs that are
<p>
However, there is one twist; not all probes are run, even though they
might be listed under an attack level.  If a SATAN probe has a question
mark ("?") appended to its name, it will run conditionally.
What does this mean?  Take, for instance, the NFS SATAN checker.  There
is no reason to run it if the remote system isn't running NFS (indeed,
you shouldn't run it, because the program will waste time timing out on
the remote host), so SATAN will only run this if it determines that NFS
is being run.
<p>
So, examining the first few lines in this section reveals:
<PRE>
    # Probes by attack level.
    #
    # ? Means conditional, controlled by rules.todo. * Matches anything.
    @light = (
            'dns.satan',
            'rpc.satan',
            'showmount.satan?',
            );
</PRE>
<p>
This means that a light scan will run the <I>dns.satan</I> and the
<I>rpc.satan</I> scans, and the <I>showmount.satan</I> if SATAN
determines that the target is running NFS.  
<p>
A bit further down shows:
<PRE>
    @normal = (
            @light, 
            'finger.satan', 
            'tcpscan.satan 70,80,ftp,telnet,smtp,nntp,uucp', 
            'udpscan.satan 53,177',
            'rusers.satan?', 
            'boot.satan?',
            );

    @heavy = (
            @normal,
            $heavy_tcp_scan = 'tcpscan.satan 1-9999',
            $heavy_udp_scan = 'udpscan.satan 1-2050,32767-33500',
            '*?',
            );
</PRE>
Nothing unusual here, except for the tcp and udp scan numbers; these
refer to the port numbers that SATAN examines for signs of activity.
<A NAME="status-file"> <H3>Status File</H3></A>
SATAN keeps track of what the latest attack is in a file.  This filename
is stored in <I>$status_file</I> and is updated before each new probe runs:
<PRE>
    # status file; keeps track of what probe is currently running and at what time it started
    $status_file = "status_file";
</PRE>
<A NAME="timeouts"> <H3>Timeouts</H3></A>
Certain network probes will "hang", or continue to try to contact the
remote host for a <STRONG>very</STRONG> long time.  To prevent this from
slowing down the overall scan, there are three timeout values (in
seconds) that SATAN recognizes:
<PRE>
    # timeout values
    $slow_timeout = 60;
    $med_timeout = 20;
    $fast_timeout = 10;
</PRE>
By default, all SATAN probes are launched with the same timeout value,
which can be set from the command line or from the HTML interface.
SATAN defaults to a medium timeout value.
<p>
Some tools need more time, such as the nfs checker, or the port scanner
when many ports are to be scanned. For this reason you override the
default timeout for specific tools. Examples:
<pre>
    %timeouts = (
            'nfs-chk', $slow_timeout,
            $heavy_tcp_scan, $slow_timeout,
            );
</pre>

<p>

<A NAME="timeout-signals"> <H3>Timeout Signals</H3></A>
When a timeout occurs, a signal is sent to the process running to stop
it.  This defaults to "9", which basically means that the process is toast:
<PRE>
    # what signal we send to nuke things when they timeout:
    $timeout_kill = 9;
</PRE>

<A NAME="prox-vars"> <H3>Proximity Variables</H3></A>
This is probably the most critical variable in the entire SATAN program.
Under <STRONG>NO</STRONG> circumstances do you want to set this to
anything over "3" unless you know <STRONG>EXACTLY</STRONG> what you're
doing!  Anything over "0" can affect sites other than your own.
<p>
Proximity refers to how close the current target is from the original
target of the SATAN probe.  For instance, if you probe
<I>victim.com</I> and find that <I>nic.ddn.mil</I> is its
nameserver, then <I>nic.ddn.mil</I>'s proximity level would be "1",
and SATAN might probe that host next, depending on the rules you choose.
<p>
The number of hosts SATAN scans can grow exponentially, so again, be
careful!
<PRE>
    #
    # Proximity variables; how far out do we attack, does severity go down, etc.
    #
    # how far out from the original target do we attack?
    $max_proximity_level = 0;
</PRE>
SATAN defaults to 0, which means that it will only scan the primary
targets selected.
<p>
As SATAN gets farther away from the primary target, the attacks will get
weaker - this presumes that you can attack your own sites as much as
desired, but since you might not know where SATAN will end up, you'd
like to be cautious the farther away the probes are going from your own
host.
<PRE>
    # Attack level drops by this much each proximity level change
    $proximity_descent = 1;
</PRE>
This value is subtracted from the current <A HREF="#attack-level">attack
level</A> - a value of zero means that attacks do not diminish in
strength.
<p>
If the attack level goes below zero, do you stop or go on?  The
"$sub_zero_proximity" variable determines this:
<PRE>
    # when we go below zero attack severity, do we stop (0) or go on (1)?
    $sub_zero_proximity = 0;
</PRE>
SATAN will, by default, examine only one target at a time.  If the
"$attack_proximate_subnets" variable is set to "1", then
<STRONG>ALL</STRONG> targets on the secondary target's subnet will be
scanned.  Be <STRONG>VERY</STRONG> careful when changing this!a
<PRE>
    # a question; do we attack subnets when we nuke a target?
    # 0 = no; 1 = primary target subnet
    $attack_proximate_subnets = 0;
</PRE>

<A NAME="trust"> <H3>Trusted or Untrusted</H3>

By default, SATAN assumes that it is being run from "inside". This
means that the probing host may appear in other hosts <i>rhosts,
hosts.equiv</i> or <i>NFS export</i> files. 

<PRE>
    #
    # Does SATAN run on an untrusted host? (0=no; 1=yes, this host may appear
    # in the rhosts, hosts.equiv or NFS export files of hosts that are being
    # probed).
    #
    $untrusted_host = 0;
</PRE>

<A NAME="exceptions"> <H3>Targeting Exceptions</H3></A>
Without precautions, SATAN can probe sites that you might not want
it to.  Exceptions are a way to prevent SATAN from going astray.
There are two ways of setting this up, and 
each is controlled by a variable name.  The <I>$only_attack_these</I>
variable is a list of domains and/or networks
that tells SATAN to only attack hosts that match one of those patterns.
For example, if you wanted SATAN to only attack educational sites,
you could say:
<PRE>
    $only_attack_these = "edu";
</PRE>
Similarly, there is a variable, <I>$dont_attack_these</I>, which you 
can set to a list of domains and/or networks that 
SATAN should <STRONG><I>never</I></STRONG> attack.
Looking at the last part of the configuration file gives further
examples of this:
<PRE>
    #
    # If $only_attack_these is non-null, *only* hit sites if they are of this
    # type.  You can specify a domain (podunk.edu) or network number
    # (192.9.9). You can specify any combination of domains and or networks
    # as long as you separate them by whitespace and/or commas.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # $only_attack_these = "podunk.edu";
    # $only_attack_these = "192.9.9";
    # $only_attack_these = "podunk.edu, 192.9.9";
    #
    $only_attack_these = "";

    #
    # Stay away from anyone that matches these patterns.
    #
    #  Example - leave government and military sites alone:
    #
    # $dont_attack_these = "gov, mil";
    $dont_attack_these = "";
</PRE>

<A NAME="workarounds"> <H3>Workarounds: DNS, ICMP</H3></A>

<h4>DNS</h4>

SATAN wants to use fully-qualified host names (<i>host.domain</i>)
so that it can fix truncated hostnames, as found, for example, in
<i>finger</i> output.
The <code>$dont_use_nslookup</code> flag controls whether
SATAN should use the <i>nslookup</i> command to look up hostnames.
<pre>
    # Set to nonzero if nslookup does not work.
    $dont_use_nslookup = 0;
</pre>

<h4>ICMP</H4>

Before probing a host, SATAN attempts to ping it. When the host does
not respond, SATAN assumes the host is down and skips further probes.
The <code>$dont_use_ping</code> controls whether SATAN should ping
hosts before probing them. Set it to a non-zero value when ICMP does
not work.  
<pre>
    # Set to nonzero if ICMP does not work.
    $dont_use_ping = 0;
</pre>
<HR>
Of course, reading the perl code in the various modules can give more
hints on all of these configuration file options.

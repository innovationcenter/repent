<HR>

<H3>Summary</H3>

File access via the TFTP service.

<H3>Impact</H3>

Unauthorized remote access to system or user files.

<H3>Background</H3>

The TFTP (trivial file transfer protocol) service provides remote
access to files, without asking for a password. It is typically used
for the initialization of diskless computers, of X terminals, or of
other dedicated hardware.

<H3>The problem</H3>

When the TFTP daemon does not limit access to specific files or hosts,
a remote intruder can use the service to obtain copies of the password
file or of other system or user files, or to remotely overwrite files.

<H3>Fix</H3>

<ul>

<li>Restrict TFTP access to only limited subtree of the file system.
Consult your tftpd manual pages for details.

<li>When no access restriction is possible, restrict TFTP access by
using a tcp wrapper.

</ul>

<H3>Other tips</H3>

<li>See the
<a href="../../docs/admin_guide_to_cracking.html#tftp">Admin
Guide to Cracking</a> for an example of why this is a problem.

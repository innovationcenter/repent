<HR>

<H3>Summary</H3>

X server access from arbitrary hosts.

<H3>Impact</H3>

A remote intruder can control the keyboard, mouse and screen.

<H3>Background</H3>

The X Window system implements an environment where applications use
the network to interact with a user workstation's display, keyboard and
mouse. There are two classes of programs:

<ul>

<li>The X server: the program that manages the user's workstation
display and input devices.

<li>X clients: the applications that run on the user's workstation or
elsewhere in the network.

</ul>

<H3>The problem</H3>

When the X server permits access from arbitrary hosts on the network, a
remote intruder can connect to the X server and:

<ul>

<li>Read the user's keyboard, including any passwords that the user
types,

<li>Read everything that is sent to the screen,

<li>Write arbitrary information to the screen,

<li>Start or terminate arbitrary applications,

<li>Take control of the user's session.

</ul>

<H3>Fix</H3>

Remove all instances of the <em> xhost +</em> command from the
system-wide <em> Xsession</em> file, from user <em> .xsession</em>
files, and from any application programs or shell scripts that use the
X window system.

</ul>

<H3>Other tips</H3>

<ul>

<li>Use the X magic cookie mechanism or equivalent. With logins under
control of <em> xdm</em>, you turn on authentication by editing the
<em> xdm-config</em> file and setting <em> the
DisplayManager*authorize</em> attribute to <em> true</em>.

<li>When granting access to the screen from another machine, use the
<em> xauth</em> command in preference to the <em> xhost</em>
command.

<li>See the
<a href="../../docs/admin_guide_to_cracking.html#x-access">Admin
Guide to Cracking</a> for an example of why this is a problem.

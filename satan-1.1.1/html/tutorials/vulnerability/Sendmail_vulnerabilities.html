<H3>Summary</H3>

Assorted sendmail vulnerabilities.

<H3>The problems</H3>

Note: this text was adapted from <a
href="ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:05.sendmail.vulnerabilities">
Cert Advisory CA-95:05</a> of February 22, 1995.

<p>

With almost every sendmail version that was built before February 1995,
a malicious user can gain unauthorized privileges by exploiting
newlines in command-line arguments or in the process environment.
Intruders need to have access to an account on your system to exploit
this problem.

<p>

In addition, pre-8.6.10 versions of sendmail that support IDENT (RFC
1413) functionality have a problem that could allow an intruder to gain
unauthorized access to your system remotely (that is, without having
access to an account on the system).

<H3>Fix</H3>

<ul>

<li>Replace sendmail by a more recent version, for example from <a
href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/sendmail">
ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:/ucb/sendmail</a>, or use a corrected version from
your vendor.

<li>Contact your vendor for information on how to get the latest
fixed/patched versions of sendmail.

<li>Consult
<a href="ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:05.sendmail.vulnerabilities">
Cert Advisory CA-95:05</a> for more information.
 
</ul>

<H3>Other tips</H3>

<li>See the
<a href="../../docs/admin_guide_to_cracking.html#sendmail">Admin
Guide to Cracking</a> for an example of why this is a problem.

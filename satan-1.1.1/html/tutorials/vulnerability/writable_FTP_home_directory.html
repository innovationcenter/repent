<HR>

<H3>Summary</H3>

FTP home directory is writable for anonymous users.

<H3>Impact</H3>

Remote command execution, remote file substitution.

<H3>The problem</H3>

When the FTP home directory of a UNIX host is writable, a remote
intruder can upload a <em>.rhosts</em> or <em>.forward</em> file to
gain access to the system, or may be able to replace files.

<p>

When a PC (DOS or MAC) permits anonymous users write access to its file
system, a remote intruder may be able replace arbitrary programs or
configuration files, or corrupt the file system by filling it up.

<H3>Fix (UNIX)</H3>

<ul>

<li>Make sure that the FTP home directory, and all system
files and directories below it, are owned by <em>root</em>.

<li>Make
sure that they are not writable by anonymous users. As a rule, no file
or directory should be owned by the FTP account.

</ul>

<H3>Other tips (UNIX)</H3>

<ul>

<li>Change the login shell of the ftp account to <tt>/bin/false</tt>.

<li>See the
<a href="../../docs/admin_guide_to_cracking.html#writable-ftp">
Admin Guide to Cracking</a> for an example of why this is a problem.

Learning how to effectively interpret the results of a SATAN scan is
the most difficult part about using SATAN.  This is partly because 
there is no "correct" security level.  "Good" security is very much
dependent on the policies and concerns of the site or system involved.
<p>
In addition, some of the concepts used in SATAN (such as why trust
and network information can be so damaging) and many of the options
that can be chosen (like proximity, proximity descent, attack filters,
etc.) will not be very familiar to many system administrators.  It
is important to read and understand the documentation to use the tool
effectively.
<p>
In the reports if there is a host listed with a red dot
(<IMG SRC="../../dots/reddot.gif">) next to it, that means the
host has a vulnerability that could compromise it.  A black dot
(<IMG SRC="../../dots/blackdot.gif">) means that no vulnerabilites
have been found for that particular host yet.  Clicking on hyperlinks
will give you more information on that host, network, piece of
information, or vulnerability, just as expected.
<p>
From the control panel in the HTML interface, select
<I>SATAN Reporting & Data Analysis</I>.  You will then be
prompted with a wealth of choices; when first learning to use
the tool, the <I>Vulnerabilities</I> section will probably
be the one of the most immediate interest.  In that section,
the <I>By Approximate Danger Level</I> link is a good place
to start.  If you find no warnings there, congratulations!  Note
that this does <U>NOT</U> mean that your host is secure - it
simply means that SATAN could not find any problems.  You
might try scanning your targets at a higher level and check this
again; in any case, you should investigate the other categories
(Hosts and Trust) in the reporting page.
<p>
The best way to learn what SATAN can do for you is by using it - 
scanning networks and examining the results with the Report and
Analysis tools can reveal interesting things about your network.
Remember, anyone has access to this informtion, so act accordingly!
<p>
Reading, or at least browsing through the full documentation is
strongly recommended - this tutorial merely covered the very basic
capabilities of SATAN.  There are a wealth of possible options that
can be used to unleash SATAN's full potential.  Be careful, however,
because it is easy to unwittingly make your neighbors think that you're
trying to attack them with the scans - <U>always</U> be certain that
you have permission to scan any potential hosts that you're thinking
of testing.

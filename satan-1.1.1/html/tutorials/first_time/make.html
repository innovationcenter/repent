There are only two steps to follow; from your Un*x shell prompt:
<p>
<OL>
<li> First, reconfigure the paths used by the programs by typing
	<I>reconfig</I> in the main SATAN directory.
<li> Then type <I> make</I>
</OL>

<p>
That should be all that is needed.  If you have any problems (remember,
SATAN is currently only <I>fully</I> supported on SunOS 4.x and IRIX 5.x, 
although this will change by the final release), you should
read the full documentation on <A HREF="../../docs/getting_started.html">
configuration and installation.</a>
<p>
You should now go to <A HREF="scanning.html"> Scanning your host or
networks</a> to see how to start scanning hosts using SATAN.
